        <p> Perhaps this site is groundbreaking for the way it was produced, or how the web app was coded, but other than that, I don’t understand or appreciate this site. Scoring in the 7 &amp; 8 range overall, I did not find the site particularly intuitive.  </p>
        
        <p> The main point of the game is a type of modified “Where’s Waldo” but with a cute dog wearing a toque. Using a flashlight, one must explore the map in order to find this dog, while mashing the spacebar to “charge” your flashlight. The mechanic of the flashlight wasn’t particularly pleasing, perhaps it was my web browser, but the light was far from where my mouse was and felt particularly uncomfortable to navigate about the map with. Furthermore, the necessity to mash the spacebar was quite anxiety inducing combined with the timer. Even as a mini time wasting game it was less than pleasing and not at all engaging. </p>
        
        <p> The only saving grace of the site is the colour palette, the typography, and the stylization of the illustrations and animations, which is the only thing I can imagine to have earned this site such a high score. Dog Studio’s primary website is my contrast quite stunning, with unique parallax animations and excellent usability. Having only just come across this second site now, I wish I had reviewed that instead. </p>
