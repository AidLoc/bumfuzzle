        <p> Atelier AM is a particularly unique selection for its very minimal approach, that allows the company’s images speak for themselves, the website is set up with a fixed logo that remains centred on the screen, acting as an overlay to the gallery images. As you scroll, each gallery image can be clicked on, at which point it slides to the right, revealing further information about the project or space. Another unique feature of the gallery is the option to view the images as a spread. When this option is selected, the images rearrange in a seemingly random order at a thumbnail size. When viewing further information about a project, one can click to scroll through a slideshow of related images, and upon completing the slideshow, they are returned to the primary gallery. </p>
        
        <p> The typography and colour scheme are simple, and muted, allowing the images to seriously be the only focus of the site, a layout such as this requires much higher quality images, in this case a common dimension seems to be minimum 2500px wide, despite this the images are well compressed and load impressively fast. </p>
        
        <p> It appears every aspect of the site is very well thought out, it has an excellent flow and is very pleasing to navigate. However, understanding the navigation took time, and features were discovered from more than one visit. I thoroughly enjoy “discovering” features of a site, but this might not be for everyone, specifically someone in a rush to access information or someone less comfortable with web navigation. </p>
