        <p> Locomotive is a minimal, grid based site, for a Canadian design agency of the same name. My impression from the start is that the website is very clean, straightforward and direct. I particularly appreciate the intractability of the grid system, as in each pane of the grid is responsive, either through type or animation. Features like this helped the website come to life and make navigating through it a fun experience. In terms of usability, I found it to be quite easy thanks to the grid, it’s clear that you’re expected to scroll down to view more parts of the website, and the navigation bar is presented clearly at the top. </p>
        
        <p> The same thing applies to the subsections of the website, which are all set up in square grids. This website is visually based, which is obviously important for a design agency. Another unique function of the website is the work / play feature. The top right corner of the site marks a an top to PLAY —>, clicking this shifts to a unique “loading screen” that I believe to be the members of the firm, followed by an inverted version of the website (now negative text), the grid is now broken up into smaller pieces and features blog entries. I find the combination of the dark background and smaller grid is much more challenging to navigate, even if it works conceptually. </p>
        
        <p> A unique interactivity portion exists on the landing page for “play” which is an interactive piece of neon script, that always snaps back to the original form. Checking this chunk out with chrome developer results that this was written in javascript (unsurprising). Despite the less navigable play section, the website is very well done, but nothing particularly groundbreaking or over the top, it is well thought out and does an excellent job presenting its content. </p>
