            <p>Hi! My name is Aiden Locke, and I’m a Design student studying at Concordia University. I specialize in digital illustration, photography, branding & film. I hail from Mississauga, Ontario, and plan to graduate in 2021, and then never go back to a city ever again. I love to hike with my dog, take my camera for long walks, and cook in any of my remaining spare time. I love to travel and am probably counting down the days until my next trip. </p>   
            <br />
            <p>In high school, I was convinced I was going to go to Waterloo to study Mechatronics, and took a heavy amount of science, computer science, and math courses (not fun). In grade 12 I became really enthralled with developing graphics for a game I was working on for a class assignment, and proceeded to completely shift my career path to design. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Considering this, I have a fairly extensive background in web development and coding, but have not practiced for over 3 years. I love the idea of computational arts, and have spent a lot of time experimenting with code based graphics. Specifically processing and P5.js are two very interesting systems / libraries that I hope to integrate into my projects in the future for this course. </p>
