        <div class="title">Review the First: Locomotive</div>
        
        <a href="https://locomotive.ca/en" target="_blank"><img class="screen" src="images/locomotive.jpg" alt="Screenshot for Locomotive"></a>
    
        <div class="container">
        
            <p> Locomotive is a minimal, grid based site, for a Canadian design agency of the same name. My impression from the start is that the website is very clean, straightforward and direct. I particularly appreciate the intractability of the grid system, as in each pane of the grid is responsive, either through type or animation. Features like this helped the website come to life and make navigating through it a fun experience. In terms of usability, I found it to be quite easy thanks to the grid, it’s clear that you’re expected to scroll down to view more parts of the website, and the navigation bar is presented clearly at the top. </p>
        
            <p> The same thing applies to the subsections of the website, which are all set up in square grids. This website is visually based, which is obviously important for a design agency. Another unique function of the website is the work / play feature. The top right corner of the site marks a an top to PLAY —>, clicking this shifts to a unique “loading screen” that I believe to be the members of the firm, followed by an inverted version of the website (now negative text), the grid is now broken up into smaller pieces and features blog entries. I find the combination of the dark background and smaller grid is much more challenging to navigate, even if it works conceptually. </p>
        
            <p> A unique interactivity portion exists on the landing page for “play” which is an interactive piece of neon script, that always snaps back to the original form. Checking this chunk out with chrome developer results that this was written in javascript (unsurprising). Despite the less navigable play section, the website is very well done, but nothing particularly groundbreaking or over the top, it is well thought out and does an excellent job presenting its content. </p>

    <div class="title">Review the Second: Snoopdogs</div>
    
    <a href="https://Snoopdogs.dogstudio.co" target="_blank"><img class="screen" src="images/snoopdogs.jpg" alt="Screenshot for Locomotive"></a>
    
    <div class="container">
        
        <p> Perhaps this site is groundbreaking for the way it was produced, or how the web app was coded, but other than that, I don’t understand or appreciate this site. Scoring in the 7 &amp; 8 range overall, I did not find the site particularly intuitive.  </p>
        
        <p> The main point of the game is a type of modified “Where’s Waldo” but with a cute dog wearing a toque. Using a flashlight, one must explore the map in order to find this dog, while mashing the spacebar to “charge” your flashlight. The mechanic of the flashlight wasn’t particularly pleasing, perhaps it was my web browser, but the light was far from where my mouse was and felt particularly uncomfortable to navigate about the map with. Furthermore, the necessity to mash the spacebar was quite anxiety inducing combined with the timer. Even as a mini time wasting game it was less than pleasing and not at all engaging. </p>
        
        <p> The only saving grace of the site is the colour palette, the typography, and the stylization of the illustrations and animations, which is the only thing I can imagine to have earned this site such a high score. Dog Studio’s primary website is my contrast quite stunning, with unique parallax animations and excellent usability. Having only just come across this second site now, I wish I had reviewed that instead. </p>

    <a><div class="title">Review the Third: Atelier AM</div></a>
        
    <a href="https://www.atelieram.com/" target="_blank"><img class="screen" src="images/atelieram.jpg" alt="Screenshot for atelier"></a>
    
    <div class="container">
        
        <p> Atelier AM is a particularly unique selection for its very minimal approach, that allows the company’s images speak for themselves, the website is set up with a fixed logo that remains centred on the screen, acting as an overlay to the gallery images. As you scroll, each gallery image can be clicked on, at which point it slides to the right, revealing further information about the project or space. Another unique feature of the gallery is the option to view the images as a spread. When this option is selected, the images rearrange in a seemingly random order at a thumbnail size. When viewing further information about a project, one can click to scroll through a slideshow of related images, and upon completing the slideshow, they are returned to the primary gallery. </p>
        
        <p> The typography and colour scheme are simple, and muted, allowing the images to seriously be the only focus of the site, a layout such as this requires much higher quality images, in this case a common dimension seems to be minimum 2500px wide, despite this the images are well compressed and load impressively fast. </p>
        
        <p> It appears every aspect of the site is very well thought out, it has an excellent flow and is very pleasing to navigate. However, understanding the navigation took time, and features were discovered from more than one visit. I thoroughly enjoy “discovering” features of a site, but this might not be for everyone, specifically someone in a rush to access information or someone less comfortable with web navigation. </p>
